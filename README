Longitude on Latitude
---------------------

Longitude is a data export tool for Google Latitude personal location
information.

Longitude is a simple Python program which serves two purposes, first, to
provide a simple, unix-y way to export your Latitude data, and second, to
serve as an example of how to fetch data from Latitude using the oauth2
module.

Requirements
------------

Python >= 2.5
Python sqlite3
Python oauth2

How to use
----------

Longitude is built as a simple tool to fetch your data from Latitude and place
it in a database for later manipulation, nothing more, and nothing less. As a
result, setup has been made as simple as possible, beyond the requirements for
safe authentication via oauth.

1) First, follow these steps to get your oauth authorization keys from Google:

    a) Visit https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageDomains
    b) Add a domain you control via "Add a New Domain"
    c) Under "Manage registration", click the domain you just added
    d) Follow the steps to verify your domain.
    e) Get your oauth consumer secret.

2) Now that your domain is set up to authenticate with Google, edit the
   "longitude.cfg" file accordingly. Set the auth domain to your domain name,
   and the secret to your oauth consumer secret.

3) Now you are ready to run Longitude. Execute longitude.py and follow the
   directions. The first time you run the program you will have to
   authenticate to the Google account you wish to export data for. Simply
   open the URL which you are prompted to open and authorize your domain.
   The oauth authentication keys (and *not* your password) will now be stored
   in the "keys" file, allowing Longitude to silently authenticate in the
   future.

4) At this point, Longitude is able to access your data and will retrieve
   as much location data as it can (currently the previous 1000 data points).
   These will be stored in the sqlite database at "loc_db".

5) If you wish to automatically import new data, at this point you can set up
   a simple cron job which changes to your Longitude directory and executes
   Longitude. Longitude will automatically skip data points which have already
   been imported, and simply import the new points which it finds.
